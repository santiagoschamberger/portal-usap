# Zoho CRM Deal Field Setup Scripts

## üìã Overview

These scripts help you set up and verify the custom fields needed for the deal webhook integration between your Partner Portal and Zoho CRM.

## üîß Available Scripts

### 1. `audit-zoho-deal-fields.ts` - Check What You Have
**Purpose**: Audits your existing Zoho CRM Deals module to see what fields are already there.

**Usage**:
```bash
npx ts-node backend/scripts/audit-zoho-deal-fields.ts
```

**What it does**:
- ‚úÖ Lists all fields in your Deals module
- ‚úÖ Checks for required standard fields
- ‚úÖ Identifies missing custom fields
- ‚úÖ Shows which fields are custom vs standard

**Run this first** to understand your current setup!

---

### 2. `setup-zoho-deal-fields.ts` - Create Missing Fields
**Purpose**: Creates any custom fields that don't exist yet in your Deals module.

**Usage**:
```bash
npx ts-node backend/scripts/setup-zoho-deal-fields.ts
```

**What it creates**:
- **StrategicPartnerId** (Text field, 50 chars) - Links deal to the portal user who created the lead

**What it checks**:
- All standard fields you need (Partner, Deal_Name, Stage, Amount, Owner)

**Note**: Based on your Zoho screenshot, you already have most fields! This only creates what's missing.

---

### 3. `document-zoho-fields.md` - Field Reference
**Purpose**: Documents all the fields visible in your Zoho CRM Deals module (from your screenshot).

**Contains**:
- Complete list of available fields organized by section
- Field types (Single Line, Lookup, Currency, etc.)
- Notes on which fields the webhook will use

---

### 4. `ZOHO_TOKEN_REFRESH_GUIDE.md` - Fix Token Issues
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide to refresh your Zoho API tokens when they expire.

**Use when you see**:
```json
{
  "error": "invalid_code"
}
```

This means your `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN` needs to be refreshed!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Don't break existing setup**: These scripts only ADD fields, they don't modify or delete existing ones
2. **Token security**: Keep your refresh token secure - it doesn't expire unless revoked
3. **Rate limiting**: Scripts include 1-second delays between field creation to avoid Zoho rate limits
4. **Backup**: Always good to export your Deals module data before making schema changes

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "invalid_code"
‚Üí Your refresh token expired. See `ZOHO_TOKEN_REFRESH_GUIDE.md`

### Error: "INVALID_TOKEN"
‚Üí Access token issue. The script generates this automatically, so check your refresh token.

### Error: "Missing required environment variables"
‚Üí Check your `.env` file has all three variables (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REFRESH_TOKEN)

### Error: Rate limit exceeded
‚Üí Zoho has API limits. Wait a few minutes and try again.

### Fields already exist
‚Üí This is normal! The scripts will skip creating fields that already exist.
