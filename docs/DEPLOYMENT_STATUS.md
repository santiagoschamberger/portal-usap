## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Before Production Deployment

**Critical Tests** (Must Pass):
1. [ ] Manual sync with existing partner
2. [ ] Status mapping verification
3. [ ] Error handling (no zoho_partner_id)
4. [ ] Authentication required
5. [ ] No duplicate leads created

**Important Tests** (Should Pass):
1. [ ] Update existing leads
2. [ ] Performance with 50+ leads
3. [ ] Concurrent sync prevention
4. [ ] UI/UX verification
5. [ ] Database integrity checks

**Optional Tests** (Nice to Have):
1. [ ] Webhook integration (if configured)
2. [ ] Mobile responsiveness
3. [ ] Accessibility checks

**Testing Guide**: See `docs/LEAD_SYNC_TESTING.md`

## üö¶ Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Railway Deployment
```bash
# Check Railway dashboard
# Both services should show "Deployed" status
# No build errors in logs
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
**Backend Service:**
- [ ] ZOHO_CLIENT_ID
- [ ] ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET
- [ ] ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN
- [ ] SUPABASE_URL
- [ ] SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- [ ] JWT_SECRET
- [ ] FRONTEND_URL

**Frontend Service:**
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (points to backend)
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

### 3. Test in Production
1. [ ] Log in as test partner
2. [ ] Navigate to Leads page
3. [ ] Click "Sync from Zoho"
4. [ ] Verify leads appear
5. [ ] Check database for correct data
6. [ ] Review Railway logs for errors

### 4. Monitor for 24 Hours
- [ ] Check error rates in Railway
- [ ] Monitor Zoho API usage
- [ ] Track sync success/failure rates
- [ ] Gather user feedback

---

## üìä Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Sync Success Rate**: Target >95%
- **Sync Duration**: <30 seconds for 100 leads
- **Error Rate**: <5%
- **API Response Time**: <2 seconds

### User Metrics
- **Feature Adoption**: Track how many partners use sync
- **Sync Frequency**: How often partners sync
- **User Satisfaction**: Gather feedback

---

## üîç Monitoring & Alerts

### What to Monitor
1. **Railway Dashboard**
   - Service health status
   - CPU/Memory usage
   - Error logs
   - Request rates

2. **Supabase Dashboard**
   - Database connections
   - Query performance
   - Storage usage

3. **Application Logs**
   - Sync success/failure
   - Zoho API errors
   - Database errors

### Alert Conditions

- [ ] API response time >5 seconds
- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Zoho API rate limit reached

---

## üêõ Known Issues

### Current Issues
None identified yet.

### Limitations
1. **Sync Limit**: 200 leads per sync (Zoho API limitation)
2. **Manual Process**: Partners must click button to sync
3. **No Real-Time Updates**: Without webhook, changes in Zoho require manual sync

### Future Enhancements
1. **Pagination**: Handle >200 leads
2. **Scheduled Sync**: Automatic daily/weekly sync
3. **Selective Sync**: Filter by date range or status
4. **Bidirectional Sync**: Update Zoho when portal leads change
5. **Sync History**: Show previous sync operations

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test Zoho API connectivity

**Rollback Steps:**
```bash
# Option 1: Rollback via Railway Dashboard
# 1. Go to Service ‚Üí Deployments
# 2. Find previous successful deployment
# 3. Click "Redeploy"

# Option 2: Rollback via Git
cd /Users/santiago/Desktop/DEV/USA\ Payments/usapayments-portal-2.0
git revert HEAD~3  # Revert last 3 commits (sync feature)
git push origin main
# Railway will auto-deploy
```

**Database Rollback:**
```sql
-- If needed, remove synced leads
DELETE FROM lead_status_history
WHERE lead_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM leads WHERE lead_source = 'zoho_sync'
);

DELETE FROM leads
WHERE lead_source = 'zoho_sync';

-- Reset partner sync status
UPDATE partners
SET last_sync_at = NULL, zoho_sync_status = 'pending';
```
