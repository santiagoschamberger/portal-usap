# üöÄ Complete Setup & Testing Guide

## Overview

Since your environment variables are configured locally and in Railway, here's how to test everything and configure Zoho webhooks in production.

---

## Part 1: Test Webhooks Locally üß™

### 1.1 Start Your Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
üöÄ Server running on port 5001 in development mode
üìä Health check: http://localhost:5001/health
‚úÖ Zoho CRM configuration validated
```

### 1.2 Test Health Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T...",
  "services": {
    "api": "running",
    "database": "connected",
    "zoho_crm": "connected"
  }
}
```

‚úÖ If `zoho_crm: "connected"` ‚Üí Your Zoho credentials are working!

### 1.3 Test Partner Creation Webhook

**Test command:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/webhooks/zoho/partner \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "ZOHO_TEST_001",
    "VendorName": "Test Partner Company",
    "Email": "testpartner@example.com"
  }'
```

**Expected success response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Partner and user created successfully",
  "data": {
    "partner_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "user_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    "email": "testpartner@example.com"
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **Verify in Supabase:**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project ‚Üí Table Editor
3. Check `partners` table ‚Üí Should see "Test Partner Company"
4. Check `auth.users` table ‚Üí Should see testpartner@example.com
5. Check `users` table ‚Üí Should see the user record

### 1.4 Test Lead Status Webhook

First, create a test lead in your database, then:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/webhooks/zoho/lead-status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "ZOHO_LEAD_123",
    "Lead_Status": "Qualified",
    "StrategicPartnerId": "partner-uuid-from-step-1.3"
  }'
```

**Note:** This will only work if the lead exists in your database with that `zoho_lead_id`.

---

## Part 5: Common Issues & Solutions üîß

### Issue 1: Webhook Returns 404

**Cause**: URL is wrong or route not registered

**Solution**:
```bash
# Test your Railway URL
curl https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/health

# Should return health status
```

### Issue 2: Webhook Returns 500

**Cause**: Environment variables missing or database error

**Solution**:
1. Check Railway environment variables
2. Verify Supabase credentials
3. Check Railway logs for error details

### Issue 3: Partner Created But No Email

**Cause**: Email service not configured yet

**Solution**:
- This is expected! Email feature is marked as "TODO"
- Partner needs manual password reset via Supabase dashboard
- **OR** implement email service (SendGrid/Resend)

### Issue 4: Lead Not Syncing to Zoho

**Cause**: Zoho API credentials invalid or partner info missing

**Solution**:
```bash
# Test Zoho connection
curl https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/health

# Check zoho_crm: "connected" in response
```

### Issue 5: Status Update Not Showing in Portal

**Cause**: Webhook not configured or lead not found

**Solution**:
1. Check if lead has `zoho_lead_id` in database
2. Verify webhook is configured in Zoho
3. Check Railway logs for webhook received message
