# Lead Sync Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive lead synchronization feature that allows partners to sync their historical leads from Zoho CRM into the partner portal with a single click.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Zoho Service (`backend/src/services/zohoService.ts`)
**Added Method**: `getLeadsByVendor(vendorId: string)`
- Fetches leads from Zoho CRM by vendor ID
- Returns up to 200 leads per request
- Uses Zoho search API with vendor criteria

```typescript
async getLeadsByVendor(vendorId: string): Promise<any> {
  const headers = await this.getAuthHeaders();
  const criteria = `(Vendor.id:equals:${vendorId})`;
  
  const response = await axios.get(`${this.baseUrl}/Leads/search`, {
    headers,
    params: { 
      criteria,
      per_page: 200
    },
  });
  return response.data;
}
```

#### 2. Leads Route (`backend/src/routes/leads.ts`)
**Added Endpoint**: `POST /api/leads/sync`
- Authenticated endpoint for syncing leads
- Fetches partner's Zoho vendor ID
- Retrieves all leads from Zoho for that vendor
- Creates or updates leads in local database
- Maps Zoho statuses to local format
- Creates status history for new leads
- Updates partner's last sync timestamp
- Returns detailed sync results

**Key Features**:
- Status mapping from Zoho to local format
- Duplicate detection using `zoho_lead_id`
- Error handling for individual leads
- Activity logging
- Comprehensive sync statistics

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Lead Service (`frontend/src/services/leadService.ts`)
**Added Method**: `syncLeadsFromZoho()`
- Calls the sync API endpoint
- Returns sync results with counts and details
- Proper TypeScript typing for response

```typescript
async syncLeadsFromZoho(): Promise<{
  total: number
  created: number
  updated: number
  skipped: number
  details: Array<{...}>
}>
```

#### 2. Zoho Service (`frontend/src/services/zohoService.ts`)
**Added Method**: `syncFromZoho()`
- Exposed in zohoService.leads namespace
- Provides clean interface for components

#### 3. Leads Page (`frontend/src/app/leads/page.tsx`)
**UI Enhancements**:
- Added "Sync from Zoho" button with icon
- Loading state during sync operation
- Toast notifications for progress and results
- Automatic refresh after sync completes
- Disabled state while syncing

**Visual Design**:
- Refresh icon with rotating animation during sync
- Branded colors matching USA Payments theme
- Clear loading indicators
- Informative success messages

## User Flow

1. Partner logs into portal
2. Navigates to Leads Management page
3. Clicks "Sync from Zoho" button
4. System shows loading indicator
5. Backend fetches leads from Zoho CRM
6. System creates/updates leads in database
7. Toast notification shows results
8. Leads table automatically refreshes
9. Partner sees all historical leads

## Technical Details

### Status Mapping
Zoho statuses are mapped to local format:
- New → new
- Contacted → contacted
- Qualified → qualified
- Proposal → proposal
- Negotiation → negotiation
- Closed Won → closed_won
- Closed Lost → closed_lost
- Nurture → nurture
- Unqualified → unqualified

### Data Synchronization
- **Create**: New leads from Zoho are inserted into local database
- **Update**: Existing leads (matched by zoho_lead_id) are updated
- **Skip**: Leads missing required fields are skipped with reason

### Security
- Requires authentication
- Partners can only sync their own leads
- Uses admin client for database operations
- Validates partner ownership
- Logs all activities

### Error Handling
- Individual lead errors don't stop sync
- Detailed error messages for each failure
- Graceful handling of missing data
- User-friendly error notifications

## API Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Leads synced successfully",
  "data": {
    "total": 50,
    "created": 30,
    "updated": 15,
    "skipped": 5,
    "details": [
      {
        "zoho_lead_id": "123456",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "status": "created",
        "lead_id": "uuid-here"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Pagination**: Handle more than 200 leads
2. **Scheduled Sync**: Automatic daily/weekly sync
3. **Sync History**: Track previous sync operations
4. **Selective Sync**: Filter by date range or status
5. **Bidirectional Sync**: Update Zoho when portal leads change
6. **Webhook Integration**: Real-time sync on Zoho changes
7. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous updates

### Monitoring
- Track sync success/failure rates
- Monitor sync duration
- Alert on repeated failures
- Track number of leads synced per partner

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing:
- `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`
- `ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN`

### Database
No schema changes required. Uses existing tables:

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check backend logs for Zoho API errors
2. Verify partner has valid zoho_partner_id
3. Confirm Zoho API credentials are valid
4. Review activity_log table for sync history
5. Check browser console for frontend errors

## Success Metrics

- Partners can sync leads in under 10 seconds (for <100 leads)
- 95%+ of leads sync successfully
- Zero data loss during sync
- Clear error messages for all failure cases
- Positive user feedback on ease of use
