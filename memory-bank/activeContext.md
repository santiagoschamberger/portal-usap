# Active Context

## Current Focus: Database Schema ✅ COMPLETE → Frontend Development

### Database Schema Status - COMPLETED September 30, 2025
- ✅ **All 7 tables created** in Supabase using MCP tools
- ✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- ✅ **9 performance indexes** applied
- ✅ **3 automated triggers** for timestamp updates
- ✅ **Foreign key constraints** enforcing data relationships
- ✅ **Backend health check** confirming database connection
- ✅ **2 partners and 2 users** exist in database (test data)

See `DATABASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` for full details.

### Current State Assessment
The frontend has been initialized with Next.js 15 and basic dependencies are installed:
- ✅ Next.js 15 with App Router
- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Tailwind CSS setup
- ✅ Basic UI components (shadcn/ui style)
- ✅ Supabase client setup
- ✅ Form handling (React Hook Form + Zod)
- ✅ State management (Zustand)
- ✅ Real-time support (Socket.IO client)

### Implemented Components
- ✅ Basic auth provider (updated to custom auth service)
- ✅ Basic UI components (button, card, input, label)
- ✅ Auth store setup (updated with JWT and custom auth)
- ✅ TypeScript types definition
- ✅ API client with interceptors
- ✅ Authentication service layer
- ✅ Protected route component with role-based access
- ✅ Permission hooks

### Recently Completed (Current Session)
- ✅ Login page (`/auth/login`) - Updated to use Supabase auth
- ✅ Forgot password page (`/auth/forgot-password`) - with success state
- ✅ Reset password page (`/auth/reset-password`) - with token validation
- ✅ Protected route system with role-based access control
- ✅ Dashboard page (`/dashboard`) - Complete with stats, quick actions, and recent activity
- ✅ Leads listing page (`/leads`) - With filtering, search, and pagination
- ✅ New lead form page (`/leads/new`) - Comprehensive lead creation form
- ✅ Test user created in Supabase: test@usapayments.com / testpassword123

### Missing Critical Components
Based on the frontend documentation, we still need to implement:

#### 1. Authentication Pages (Completed ✅)
- ✅ Login page (`/login`)
- ✅ Forgot password page (`/forgot-password`)
- ✅ Reset password page (`/reset-password`)
- ❌ Register page (`/register`) - disabled but structure needed

#### 2. User Dashboard Pages (High Priority)
- ✅ Main dashboard (`/dashboard`) - Complete with stats and navigation
- ❌ Submit referral page (`/submit`)
- ❌ Compensation page (`/compensation`)
- ❌ Sub accounts page (`/sub-accounts`)
- ❌ Tutorials page (`/tutorials`)
- ❌ User settings page (`/settings`)

#### 3. Public Pages (Medium Priority)
- ❌ Public referral page (`/referral/[uuid]`)

#### 4. Admin Pages (Medium Priority)
- ❌ Admin dashboard (`/admin`)
- ❌ User management (`/admin/users`)
- ❌ Tutorial management (`/admin/tutorials`)
- ❌ Admin settings (`/admin/settings`)

#### 5. Core Components (High Priority)
- ❌ Layout component with navigation
- ❌ Protected route component
- ❌ Form components (BusinessTypeSelect, PhoneInput, etc.)
- ❌ Data components (StatsCard, tables, etc.)
- ❌ Referral components

#### 6. Services (High Priority)
- ❌ API service layer
- ❌ User service
- ❌ Tutorial service
- ❌ Settings service
- ❌ Zoho service integration
- ❌ Admin service

### Next Immediate Steps
1. **Create the layout component** with role-based navigation
2. **Implement authentication pages** (login, forgot password, reset password)
3. **Create protected route component** for role-based access
4. **Build the main dashboard** with stats and data tables
5. **Implement the submit referral page** (core business function)

### Technical Decisions Made
- Using Next.js 15 with App Router
- Supabase for backend integration ([[memory:4551636]])
- shadcn/ui component pattern for consistent UI
- Zustand for state management
- React Hook Form + Zod for form handling

### Current Challenges
- Need to establish API service layer for backend communication
- Need to implement proper authentication flow with JWT
- Need to create role-based access control system
- Need to integrate with Zoho CRM for referral submission

### Implementation Strategy
Following the user's preference ([[memory:4551642]]), I'll pick the most logical implementation order:
1. Start with authentication system (login/logout flow)
2. Build core layout and navigation
3. Implement main dashboard
4. Add referral submission functionality
5. Complete remaining user pages
6. Add admin functionality

This approach ensures we have a working authentication system first, then build out the core user functionality before adding administrative features.
