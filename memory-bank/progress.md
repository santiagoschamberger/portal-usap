## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Email Notifications**: Not configured (requires provider setup)
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Socket.IO not yet connected in production
3. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases need more graceful handling
4. **Loading States**: Some pages need better loading indicators

### Technical Debt
1. **Test Coverage**: Need more unit and integration tests
2. **Error Logging**: Should integrate Sentry or similar
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Need APM solution
4. **Documentation**: API documentation needs OpenAPI/Swagger spec

### Deployment Notes
1. **Frontend CORS**: Needs backend URL whitelisting
2. **Webhook URLs**: Need to be configured in Zoho CRM for production
3. **Environment Sync**: Prod and dev environments need clear separation

## Recent Critical Fix (October 27, 2025)

### Deal Sync Webhook Missing

**Issue Discovered:**
- Sub-accounts creating leads successfully
- Leads converting to deals in Zoho CRM
- **Deals NOT appearing in portal**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
System had three webhooks:
1. ✅ Partner webhook - Creating partners
2. ✅ Lead status webhook - Updating lead status
3. ✅ Contact webhook - Creating sub-accounts
4. ❌ **MISSING: Deal webhook** - Receiving deal creation/updates

**Fix Implemented:**
- Created `/api/webhooks/zoho/deal` endpoint
- Listens for deal creation/update events
- Links deals to partners via Vendor.id
- Attributes deals to sub-accounts via StrategicPartnerId
- Full stage tracking and activity logging

**Learning:**
When Zoho CRM converts a lead to a deal, it's a **separate entity** in a different module. You need a dedicated webhook for each module you want to sync. Cannot assume lead webhook will handle deals.

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ Code written and tested
- ✅ TypeScript compiled
- ⏳ Awaiting deployment to Railway
- ⏳ Zoho webhook configuration required

## Recent Decisions & Learnings

### Architectural Decisions

#### Database Choice: Supabase
**Decision**: Use Supabase instead of raw PostgreSQL
**Reasoning**: 
- Built-in Auth system
- Row Level Security
- Real-time capabilities
- Managed infrastructure
- Generous free tier

**Outcome**: Excellent choice, RLS policies working perfectly

#### Authentication Strategy: JWT + Supabase Auth
**Decision**: Hybrid approach using Supabase Auth with custom JWT
**Reasoning**:
- Supabase handles user management
- Custom JWT for API authentication
- Refresh token strategy for security
- Role-based access control

**Outcome**: Working well, flexible and secure

#### Zoho Integration: Webhooks + API
**Decision**: Bi-directional sync using webhooks and API calls
**Reasoning**:
- Real-time updates via webhooks
- Controlled data flow via API
- Maintains data integrity
- Scales well

**Outcome**: Fully functional, both directions working

### Technical Learnings

#### Supabase RLS Gotcha
**Issue**: RLS policies were blocking service role operations
**Solution**: Created security definer functions for operations requiring elevated permissions
**Learning**: Use security definer functions for cross-user operations

#### Zoho CRM Field Mapping
**Issue**: Custom fields need exact API names
**Solution**: Used `StrategicPartnerId` as the linking field
**Learning**: Document all custom field mappings

#### Next.js 15 App Router
**Issue**: Different patterns from Pages Router
**Solution**: Learned Server Components and client components distinction
**Learning**: Server Components by default, use 'use client' deliberately

#### Railway Deployment
**Issue**: Build command needed TypeScript compilation
**Solution**: Added explicit build script in package.json
**Learning**: Railway needs explicit build configuration
